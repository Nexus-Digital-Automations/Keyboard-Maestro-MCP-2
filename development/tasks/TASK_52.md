## 🎯 Problem Analysis
**Classification**: Visual Interface & Workflow Design Gap
**Gap Identified**: No visual workflow designer, drag-and-drop interface, or interactive macro building for Claude Desktop interaction
**Impact**: Cannot create complex workflows visually, limiting accessibility and reducing automation development efficiency

<thinking>
Root Cause Analysis:
1. Current platform lacks visual workflow design capabilities
2. No drag-and-drop interface for macro construction
3. Missing visual representation of automation flows
4. Cannot export/import visual workflow designs
5. No integration with Claude Desktop for visual automation building
6. Essential for user-friendly automation creation
7. Must integrate with existing macro creation and template systems
8. FastMCP tools needed for Claude Desktop JSON-RPC interaction
