**Status**: COMPLETED âœ…
**Assigned**: Agent_ADDER+ (Advanced Strategic Extension)
**Dependencies**: Visual automation (TASK_35), Interface automation (TASK_37), Testing framework (TASK_31)
**Blocking**: Accessibility compliance testing and assistive technology integration for automation workflows

## ðŸ“– Required Reading (Complete before starting)

- [x] **FastMCP Protocol**: development/protocols/FASTMCP_PYTHON_PROTOCOL.md - MCP tool implementation standards âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] **Core Types**: src/core/types.py - Type definitions for accessibility structures âœ… COMPLETED

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Analysis
**Classification**: Accessibility Compliance & Testing Gap
**Gap Identified**: No accessibility compliance testing, WCAG validation, or assistive technology integration for automation workflows
**Impact**: Cannot ensure accessibility compliance, test assistive technology compatibility, or validate inclusive automation design

<thinking>
Root Cause Analysis:
1. Current platform lacks accessibility compliance testing capabilities
2. No WCAG validation or accessibility standard verification
3. Missing assistive technology integration and testing
4. Cannot validate automation accessibility or inclusive design
5. No accessibility reporting or compliance documentation
6. Essential for enterprise compliance and inclusive automation
7. Must integrate with existing visual and interface automation systems
8. FastMCP tools needed for Claude Desktop accessibility management
</thinking>
