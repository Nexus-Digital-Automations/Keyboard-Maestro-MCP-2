## 🎯 Problem Analysis
**Classification**: Comprehensive Testing & Quality Assurance Gap
**Gap Identified**: No comprehensive automated testing framework, regression testing, or quality assurance for complex automation workflows
**Impact**: Cannot ensure automation reliability, prevent regressions, or validate complex workflow interactions

<thinking>
Root Cause Analysis:
1. Current platform has basic macro testing but lacks comprehensive automation testing
2. No regression testing or continuous quality assurance framework
3. Missing integration testing for complex workflow interactions
4. Cannot test automation under various system conditions and loads
5. No automated quality metrics or testing dashboards
6. Essential for enterprise-grade automation reliability
7. Must extend existing testing framework with advanced capabilities
8. FastMCP tools needed for Claude Desktop testing management
