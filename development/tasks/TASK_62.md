### Phase 1: Zero Trust Architecture
- [x] **Security types**: Define zero trust security types and validation frameworks âœ… COMPLETED
- [ ] **Policy engine**: Dynamic security policy creation and enforcement
- [ ] **FastMCP integration**: Security tools for Claude Desktop interaction

### Phase 2: Core Security Engine
- [x] **Trust validator**: Continuous trust validation and verification system âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] **Policy enforcer**: Dynamic policy enforcement and compliance monitoring âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] **Security monitor**: Real-time security monitoring and threat detection âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] **Access controller**: Granular access control with context-aware permissions âœ… COMPLETED

### Phase 3: MCP Tools Implementation
- [x] **km_validate_trust**: Continuous trust validation and verification âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] **km_enforce_security_policy**: Dynamic security policy enforcement âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] **km_monitor_security_posture**: Real-time security monitoring and assessment âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] **km_manage_access_control**: Granular access control management âœ… COMPLETED

### Phase 4: Advanced Security Features
- [x] **Threat detection**: AI-powered threat detection and response âœ… COMPLETED
- [ ] **Risk assessment**: Continuous risk assessment and mitigation
- [x] **Compliance monitoring**: Automated compliance checking and reporting âœ… COMPLETED
- [ ] **Incident response**: Automated incident response and remediation

### Phase 5: Integration & Validation
- [ ] **Enterprise integration**: Integration with existing enterprise security systems
- [ ] **Continuous monitoring**: Real-time security posture monitoring
- [ ] **TESTING.md update**: Zero trust security testing and validation
- [ ] **Documentation**: Zero trust security implementation guide
