## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Analysis
**Classification**: Voice Control & Speech Recognition Gap
**Gap Identified**: Limited voice capabilities, missing voice command recognition, speech-to-automation conversion, and hands-free control
**Impact**: Cannot provide voice-controlled automation, hands-free operation, or accessibility features for speech-based interaction

## âœ… Implementation Subtasks (Sequential completion)
### Phase 1: Architecture & Design
- [ ] **Voice types**: Define types for speech recognition, voice commands, and audio processing
- [ ] **Speech integration**: Speech-to-text and text-to-speech integration with system APIs
- [ ] **FastMCP integration**: Voice control tools for Claude Desktop interaction

### Phase 2: Core Voice Engine
- [ ] **Speech recognizer**: Real-time speech recognition and voice command processing
- [ ] **Intent processor**: Voice command intent recognition and action mapping
- [ ] **Voice feedback**: Text-to-speech response system with natural voice synthesis
- [ ] **Command dispatcher**: Voice command execution and automation workflow triggering

### Phase 3: MCP Tools Implementation
- [ ] **km_process_voice_commands**: Process voice commands and execute automation workflows
- [ ] **km_configure_voice_control**: Configure voice recognition settings and command mappings
- [ ] **km_provide_voice_feedback**: Provide voice feedback and confirmation responses
- [ ] **km_train_voice_recognition**: Train and customize voice recognition for user voices

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- [ ] **Multi-language support**: Support for multiple languages and accents
- [ ] **Speaker identification**: Speaker identification and personalized automation
- [ ] **Noise filtering**: Advanced noise filtering and audio enhancement
- [ ] **Continuous listening**: Wake word detection and continuous voice monitoring

### Phase 5: Integration & Accessibility
- [ ] **Accessibility features**: Voice control accessibility features for users with disabilities
- [ ] **Integration testing**: Voice control integration with existing automation workflows
- [ ] **TESTING.md update**: Voice control testing coverage and accuracy validation
- [ ] **Documentation**: Voice control user guide and configuration instructions
