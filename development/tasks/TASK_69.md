<thinking>
Current Situation Analysis:
1. Project claims 100% task completion but only ~10% test coverage
2. TESTING.md claims "100% test pass rate" but this is likely misleading
3. Need systematic approach to identify actual test failures
4. Must expand coverage to near 100% as requested
5. Focus on genuine functional tests, not shortcuts
6. Apply ADDER+ techniques: contracts, property-based testing, defensive programming

Strategy:
1. Run comprehensive test suite to get actual current status
2. Systematically fix failing tests by category
3. Identify untested code paths and create comprehensive tests
4. Focus on integration tests for MCP tools
5. Implement property-based testing for complex logic
6. Validate contract compliance across all tools
