"""
Goal management system for autonomous agents.

This module provides comprehensive goal management including creation, prioritization,
tracking, and achievement verification for autonomous agents. Implements sophisticated
goal decomposition and dependency management.

Security: All goals validated for safety and resource feasibility
Performance: <100ms goal operations, <500ms priority recalculation
Enterprise: Complete audit trail and goal lifecycle tracking
