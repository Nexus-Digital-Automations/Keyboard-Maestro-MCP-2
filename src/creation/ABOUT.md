# Macro Creation Engine

## Purpose
Comprehensive macro creation system enabling AI assistants to programmatically create Keyboard Maestro automation workflows with enterprise-grade security validation and template-based patterns.

## Key Components  
- **MacroBuilder**: Core creation engine with security validation, rollback support, and AppleScript integration
- **MacroTemplateGenerator**: Abstract template system with 5+ concrete implementations for common automation patterns
- **MacroCreationRequest**: Type-safe request container with comprehensive validation and security checks

## Architecture & Integration
**Dependencies**: Core types system, KM client integration, contracts framework for Design by Contract implementation
**Patterns**: Factory Pattern + Template Method + Builder Pattern for flexible macro construction with security boundaries
**Integration**: FastMCP tool registration with parameter validation, error handling, and progress reporting

## Critical Considerations
- **Security**: Multi-layer validation with injection prevention, script sanitization, and safe AppleScript generation
- **Performance**: <2 second creation time for simple templates, <5 seconds for complex workflows, <10MB memory usage
